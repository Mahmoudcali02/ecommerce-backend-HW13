# ecommerce-backend-HW13
As a Developer I was tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying a starter code. I will take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

# Note:
This app is not fully developed and it is still under construction.
It will be ready in a few days as I am still working on it.
